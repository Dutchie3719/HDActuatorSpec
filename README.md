# High Definition Actuator Specification

Consumer devices increasingly utilize haptics as part of the core user experience. This has increased awareness of the value of haptic feedback as well as increased understanding by consumers that not all haptic experiences are the same. Among device manufacturers and component suppliers, there is a lack of standardization of the key technical specifications that impact the haptic performance of a given actuator component. 

 

The goal of this document is to define standard metrics and their corresponding tests to enable inertial haptic actuators to be evaluated consistently and objectively. Utilizing this specification, a product designer can readily compare actuators in terms of their ability to render high quality haptics. Actuator vendors may use this specification to precisely characterize the haptic quality of their offerings. 

 

High quality inertial haptic actuators are often said to enable “HD haptics,” but this term lacks a precise technical definition. Through the collaborative efforts of the Haptics Industry Forum, this document was created to serve as a common reference for what constitutes an “inertial HD actuator.”
